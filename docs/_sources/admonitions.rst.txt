Admonitions
===========
`Admonitions <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/0.3/spec/rst/directives.html#admonitions>`_ are specially marked topics that can appear 
anywhere in your document as an ordinary body element. Any text immediately following the directive indicator (on the same line or indented 
on following lines) is interpreted as a directive block and is parsed for normal body elements. Typically, an admonition is rendered as an 
offset block in a document, sometimes outlined or shaded, with a title matching the admonition type.

The following admonition directives are supported:

* ``attention``
* ``caution``
* ``danger``
* ``error``
* ``hint``
* ``important``
* ``note``
* ``tip``
* ``warning``

.. highlight:: none

The following ``note`` admonition directive contains multiple paragraphs. ::

	.. note:: Use a note for information you want the user to pay particular attention to.

	   If note text runs over a line, make sure the lines wrap and are indented to
	   the same level as the note tag. If formatting is incorrect, part of the note
	   might not render in the HTML output.

	   Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must indent to 
	   the same level as the rest of the note.

It is rendered as

.. note:: Use a note for information you want the user to pay particular attention to.

   If note text runs over a line, make sure the lines wrap and are indented to
   the same level as the note tag. If formatting is incorrect, part of the note
   might not render in the HTML output.

   Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs mustindent to 
   the same level as the rest of the note.

The following ``warning`` admonition directive contains an unordered list. ::

	.. warning:: Use a warning for information the user must understand to avoid negative consequences.
		
	   You can include any body element in the admonition such as an unordered list.

	   * First list item.
	   * Second list item.

It is rendered as

   * Second list item.

Generic admonitions
*******************
You can create a `generic admonition <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/0.3/spec/rst/directives.html#generic-admonition>`_ with the ``admonition`` directive. The title of the admonition is specified after the directive. 

The following generic admonition it titled "RTFM". ::

	.. admonition:: RTFM

   	   Read the flipping manual!

It is rendered as

.. admonition:: RTFM

   Read the flipping manual!

The admonition title is used as a class attribute value after being converted into a valid identifier form (down cased, non-alphanumeric 
characters converted to single hyphens, and "admonition-" prefixed) as illustrated by the following document tree pseudo-XML ::

	<document source="test data">
        <admonition class="admonition-rtfm">
            <title>
                RTFM
            <paragraph>
                You should read the flipping manual!


You can then include the class in the admonition using the ``:class:`` specifier.
