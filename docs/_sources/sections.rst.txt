Sections 
========
`Sections <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#sections>`_ are identified through their titles, which are marked up with adornment characters.

* Many adornment characters are supported. However, the following characters are recommended ``=``, ``-``, ``_``, ``*``, ``+``, and ``#``.
* The characters are specified as underlines below the title text or underlines and matching overlines above the title.
* An underline or overline is a single repeated character that begins in column 1 and forms a line extending at least as far as the right edge of the title text. 
* Underline-only adornment styles are distinct from overline-and-underline styles that use the same character. 
* There may be any number of levels of section titles, although some output formats may have limits (e.g. HTML has 6 levels).

Rather than imposing a fixed number and order of section title adornment styles:

* The order enforced will be the order as encountered. 
* The first style encountered will be an outermost title (e.g. HTML ``<h1>``), the second style will be a subtitle, the third will be a subsubtitle, and so on.
* Documents should consistently use the established section title hierarchy.
