Sections and Transitions
========================
Sections
--------
`Sections <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#sections>`_ are identified through their titles, which are marked up with adornment characters.

* Many adornment characters are supported. However, the following characters are recommended ``=``, ``-``, ``_``, ``*``, ``+``, and ``#``.
* The characters are specified as underlines below the title text or underlines and matching overlines above the title.
* An underline or overline is a single repeated character that begins in column 1 and forms a line extending at least as far as the right edge of the title text. 
* Underline-only adornment styles are distinct from overline-and-underline styles that use the same character. 
* There may be any number of levels of section titles, although some output formats may have limits (e.g. HTML has 6 levels).

Rather than imposing a fixed number and order of section title adornment styles:

* The order enforced will be the order as encountered. 
* The first style encountered will be an outermost title (e.g. HTML ``<h1>``), the second style will be a subtitle, the third will be a subsubtitle, and so on.
* A document should consistently use the established section title hierarchy.

Transitions
-----------
`Transitions <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#transitions>`_ separate other body elements and can be used to mark 
text divisions or signal changes in subject, time, point of view, or emphasis.

To create a transition:

* Type a horizontal line of 4 or more repeated characters. 

	* The available characters are the same ones used for section titles.
	* All characters produce the same result; pick one and use it consistently.

* Include a blank line before and after the transition characters.
* Do not begin or end a section or document with a transition, and do not specify adjacent transitions.

.. highlight:: none

The following characters all produce a transition. ::

The transition is rendered as a HTML ``<hr>`` element.

Remember, you can't end a document with a transition!
