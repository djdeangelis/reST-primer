Welcome to the reStructuredText Primer!
=======================================

The reStructuredText Primer serves two purposes. First, it is a project by which I can learn reStructuredText and, 
to a lesser extent, Sphinx and Docutils. Second, it is a resource for others to learn the basics of reStructuredText. 

My primary resources are: 

* `reStructuredText Markup Specification <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_
* `reStructuredText Cheat Sheet <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/cheatsheet.txt>`_
* `Online reStructuredText Editor <http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_
